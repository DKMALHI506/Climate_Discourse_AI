# Climate Change Discourse on X

## What’s This About?
I scraped X posts about climate change to figure out who’s a believer, skeptic, or neutral, 
then mapped where those opinions come from. Used BERT for classifying and Folium for a sweet interactive map. 
It’s a bit rough, but I love how it shows real people’s thoughts!

## Files
Climate_discourse.ipynb`: The code—scrapes tweets, classifies them, and makes a map.
Climate_posts.csv`: My scraped data (or use your own).
Climate_map.html`: Open this in a browser to see the map!
Requirements.txt`: Stuff you need to run it.
Opinion_pie.png`: A pie chart of the opinion breakdown.

## How to Run It
1. Get an X API key and plug it into the notebook (took me a day to get approved).
2. Install libs from `requirements.txt` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run `climate_discourse.ipynb` in Jupyter—might take a bit with BERT.
4. Check `climate_map.html` after—it’s interactive!

## What I Got


## Why It Matters
This is all about how AI can dig into what people think and maybe help shape climate policies. Totally fits the PSL Master’s focus on tech and society—I’m hooked now!
